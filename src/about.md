<p><i>Email words@belvoirwriting.co.uk to join our next meeting or to find out more</i>.</p>
  
<p>We are a group of writers meeting in Bottesford every second Tuesday of the month at 8pm in the Old School next to the library. </p>
</p>
<p>Our aims are to help writers find their own voice, to feel confident and encouraged with their writing, and to provide supportive space to try out new ideas. We also want to keep this free for everyone, with no membership or attendance fees and to provide a creative resource and outlet for the community.</p>

## How it all began

It all started in 2018 with the vicar very kindly letting us set up and host the Vale of Belvoir Writing Group in St Mary's Church, Bottesford. There have been monthly themes and ideas to write to, the odd flash writing exercise every now and again, as well as visits from published authors and academics.

## You're on mute

Things took a turn in 2020 and we found ourselves unable to meet in the church or anywhere else. Technology helped and hindered in equal measure and we were able to see each other via Google Meet for a couple of years while this whole covid thing sorted itself out, but it relied on everything working for everyone at the same time. 

### Old School 

At the end of 2022 we were fortunate to find a new home in the real world. We now meet in the Parish Room, the Old School, Grantham Road, Bottesford. We welcome writers from all over the Vale of Belvoir and beyond. It doesn't matter if you're from Bottesford, Plungar, Redmile, Granby, Muston, Stathern, Eastwell, Grantham, Melton, Nottingham or anywhere else. Most members are from Bottesford and surrounding villages and all contribute to our friendly community of writers.

#### Join us at our next meeting

We meet every second Tuesday of the month at 8pm in the Parish Room, The Old School (next to the library) in Bottesford. We have optional themes for each meeting, which you can choose to write about or completely ignore. Some people like to share their works in progress, but there's no obligation to bring or read out any writing. <br>
