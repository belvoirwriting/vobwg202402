Before we go any further, I’m really happy to share that Helene’s book is available for pre-order. We saw some early mock-up pages a few months ago and soon you’ll be able to get the finished product of Microbiome: The Universe Inside You.

We’ll start 2025 with the obvious new year theme of “resolutions”. Will you resolve to be at our first meeting of the year on 14 January at 8pm? We’ll be at the Parish Room in the Old School next to Bottesford library for about 90 minutes of writing chat, feedback, encouragement and resolutions. (As ever, ignore the theme if you’ve got something else you want to share.)

My resolution could be to keep the blog updated. But I do have a passing curiosity in forgotten blogs and abandoned podcasts. Sometimes a search will lead me to old blogs, once regularly updated, seemingly entertaining and occasionally useful yet now preserved in internet amber. The gaps between posts get wider and there may be one or two final updates, apologies for life getting in the way of producing anything new and promises to get back to regular posting. And then silence interrupted only by the occasional commenter either real or bot.

The blog on the website may go quiet every now and again but we’ll continue to meet on the second Tuesday of every month, just as we have for about seven years now and hopefully for as long as there are writers writing in the Vale of Belvoir. 2024 was a great year for the group, full of interesting new voices and discussions that took us over our usual half nine-ish finish. I’m looking forward to seeing you all again to kick off 2025 with more great writing.
