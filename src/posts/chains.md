Chains is an invitation to bring the next part of your literary work in progress to our meeting on 18 April 2021 (8pm via Google Meet).

Chains could also be something to start off a new piece about what connects, anchors, restrains or bonds us.

Share your writing, your stories, poems, or assorted musings with other writers in the Vale of Belvoir, from Bottesford, Muston, Barkestone, Plungar, Redmile and wherever else you may be from, at the next meeting.
