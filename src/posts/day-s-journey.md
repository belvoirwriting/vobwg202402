Make the trek to our next meeting on 9 February 2021. The optional challenge is to make a journey in a day. Use whatever map you would like, whether it's [Christopher Vogler's memo](https://livingspirit.typepad.com/files/chris-vogler-memo-1.pdf) or something a little more [historical and geographical](https://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/content/catalogue_item/bottesford-local-history-archive/historic-maps-parish), and complete your story in a day. That could be a day of writing time or a narrative that unfolds over the course of a day.
