Do you create carefully crafted blueprints for your stories? Are your plans sketched on the back of an envelope? Do you rely on the muse and a mug of builder's tea to get to the next chapter?

Our theme for December 2020 is construction and we welcome any interpretation, no matter how you put your writing together.

Join us on 8 December 2020 at 8pm via Google Meet and bring along what you've built, whether it's on the theme of construction or anything else that inspires you this month.

To join the next meeting or to find out more get in touch via our contact page. And as an extra bonus Mark's notes on Kindle publishing will be sent with the invitations.
