We may have had a delayed start to our 2026 meetings, but what a way to do it. In something of a first for the group, we had an unexpected reunion. It was our own moment of real-life poetry later captured, along with the rest of the meeting, in verse by Will. You can read his poem on the website <a href="https://belvoirwriting.co.uk/2026/02/15/remember-to-breathe/">here</a>.

Cat’s closer to releasing the first novel in her new trilogy. She’s working through edits and artwork for the cover. We can’t wait to see the final copy and to link here to all the places you can find it. Until then you can keep up to date with Cat’s progress by following:

February’s theme of “cover” was taken up tangentially if you count getting covered in water while chasing down a whale-like creature in science-fiction, lyrically as masks were thrown off in narrative poetry, and ingeniously as Spanish disgruntlement drew us into a story about English lessons from a sunburned cover teacher. 

The trip to Spain took us to exploring how alternating points of view and providing different perspectives can gradually reveal the full story. 

We also discussed different experiences of writing characters from the concept of a green room where they wait patiently for you to call them into the story to a noisy dinner table where they’re competing and demanding to be heard. 

On the non-fiction front, we talked about developing the throughline or thematic links between chapters which brought us to the sole new addition to our imaginary bibliography Pig Wrestling by Pete Lindsay and Mark Bawden.

We’re back to our regular schedule, so please join us on 10 March at 8pm in the usual place of the Parish Room in the Old School, Bottesford.

Our optional theme or prompt for March is “projection”, perhaps a financial forecast, psychological displacement, or cine film home movies flickering against a wall or however you want to interpret it or not. Whether you tackle the theme or just want an evening with a group of fellow writers, it would be great to see you.
