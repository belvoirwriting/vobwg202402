The website has been through a few changes over the last few months as we've moved away from the paid service that offered so much but delivered so little. And just like the title says, sometimes you have to write your own magic. What worlds can you wish into existence? What spells can you cast to conjure up captivating stories? Whatever the source of your sorcery we'd love to share in that wonder with you.
