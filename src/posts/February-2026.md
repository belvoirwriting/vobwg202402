We're back to our regular schedule starting again on Tuesday 10 February at 8pm in the usual place of the Parish Room in the Old School, Bottesford. 

We also have an optional writing theme or prompt for the month - “cover”. As always this is completely optional and ignorable but if you want to write on the theme of “cover” it could be however it inspires you most. For example, it could relate to a blanket, to music, to insurance, or to what your longtime buddy in the police department asks for on the day before his retirement while you’re in a shootout with some baddies.
