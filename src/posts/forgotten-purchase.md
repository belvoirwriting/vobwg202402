Hurry! This offer must end! Use the promo code BELVOIR for an extra 50% off.  Off what? We can’t remember. 

Our theme for November is 'forgotten purchase'. Join us on 10 November 2020 at 8pm via Google Meet to share tales of your own forgotten purchases or whatever else you'd like to write.

Just what did you buy in the middle of the night? What wonders have travelled six months on the slow boat from China? Is it like a surprise gift from your past self?

And as an extra special bonus offer,  our very own pioneering author Mark Spruce will talk us through the process of getting your book out onto Kindle from proof copy to publication. Mark’s book is available [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dad-Box-Mark-Spruce/dp/B08KGZZR79/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= "Dad in a Box on Amazon") and he kindly wrote a few words about it for us [here](https://belvoirwriting.co.uk/dad-in-a-box).
