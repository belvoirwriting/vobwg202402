Fly as far as your imagination will take you with our March 2021 theme of escape.

The theme was inspired by, or shamelessly ripped off of, Shooter's call for submissions. [Shooter](https://shooterlitmag.com/submissions/) is a literary magazine that publishes short stories, non-fiction and poetry. Escape-themed submissions should be sent to them by the deadline of April 25th, 2021.

Our own escape committee will meet by the tunnels on 9 March 2021. [Contact us](https://belvoirwriting.co.uk/contact) to find out more.
