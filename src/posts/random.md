The next meeting will be on Tuesday 9 July 2024. Same time, same venue. 8pm in the Parish Room in the Old School next to Bottesford Library. 

We had a great June meeting sharing lots of ~~biscuits~~ new writing including action-adventure in the late Iron Age, anticipating the Korean War from the Cotswolds, an inspiring and informative journey into the garden and a very, very short story on the unexpected utility of the wok.

We spoke briefly again about fun with Scrivener. It would be interesting to hear if you’ve tried some of the other tools out there, such as Ulysses, Final Draft, or iA Writer, for example, or if Word or Pages are enough for you. I’ve wasted far too much potential writing time reading app reviews online, similar to how I’d spend far too long choosing the perfect paper notebook in the pre-smartphone era, but hearing about your own experiences would be far more useful.

If anyone wants a theme or writing prompt for the next meeting, we’re going with “random”. This is inspired in part by the chat from the May meeting about using dice or story cubes to help with story telling. Random, as with all of the themes, is completely optional and can be whatever you want it to mean. It could be a chance encounter, a piece based on a randomly plucked word from the dictionary, or challenging the idea that anything can be random in the first place. 

Enjoy your next month of writing. If you’re interested in joining us, please email words@belvoirwriting.co.uk. There are no charges, or membership fees or anything like that. We’ve been very lucky over the last six years or so to be able to keep this as a free and informal group for anyone interested in writing in the Vale of Belvoir and beyond.
