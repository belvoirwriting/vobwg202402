February’s theme, randomly plucked from the air at the end of the last meeting, is “pivot” (or “pivot!” as was suggested in reference to this [scene from *Friends*](https://youtu.be/EPSpBrNyxQM)).

Pivot could be a turning point in a plot or a character’s arc. 

In *[Save the Cat! Writes a Novel](https://www.jessicabrody.com/books/non-fiction/save-cat-writes-novel/about/)*, Jessica Brody describes the ["Midpoint”](https://www.jessicabrody.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Save_the_Cat_Writes_a_Novel_Starter_Kit_v6.pdf) of a story as its pivot point. Everything else hangs off this exciting, dynamic point as stakes are raised, pushing the hero toward their transformation.

Similar pivots may be found in biographies or autobiographies as moments that changed everything for the subject or a decision taken to move in a new direction. 

In poetry, a refrain could be employed, such as with “Nevermore” in The Raven, which Edgar Allen Poe describes in *[The Philosophy of Composition](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55749/55749-h/55749-h.htm)* as “some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn.” (And yes, I am only thinking of *The Simpsons*' Treehouse of Horror.)

Pivot could also be something you do with spreadsheets, a shaft or pin to support something that turns or balances, or a [pirouette](https://www.glendagibson.com/post/wobbly-stone) or other dance turn. 

We had another wide range of writing shared at the last meeting - dystopian science fiction (with full marks for how the “resolutions” theme was used), action adventure, historical mystery, poetry, and supernatural shenanigans. So, please bring along whatever you’re working on and use or completely ignore the theme as you prefer. 

There was also some writing software chat last time and, for once, it wasn’t about the usual one. [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com) was recommended for its critique function and because it’s an online tool that can be used anywhere on multiple device types. [Ayoya](https://www.ayoa.com) also got a mention. It’s a productivity and mind mapping tool available on the web and with Android and iOS apps.

Let us know if you find any other useful writing tools or if nothing can beat a good old fashioned notebook and pen.
