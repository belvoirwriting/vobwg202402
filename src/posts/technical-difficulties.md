Our theme for the 12 March 2024 meeting is "technical difficulties". See you at 8pm in the Parish Room, Bottesford.

**Turn it off and on again**

All the old posts are back on the website after an interlude using a supposedly fancier way of putting these things together. We're back to using string and sticky tape and, while there are now some gaps for some of the more recent meetings and the images need adding again, it should make it easier to publish new content. I could blame all of these things on technical difficulties, but it might be more accurate to say I was being difficult with technology. The next thing will be to reinstate the custom email address. I'm sure the solution to that will be similar to fixing the website - turn it off and on again.
> <b>Edit 20/2/24:</b> words@belvoirwriting.co.uk is working again. It was a bit more complicated than turning it off and on again but it was a similar principle. I'll save that for another post.

**Frustration or a fresh start?**

Please feel free to use, modify or ignore the optional theme of "technical difficulties" for your February and March writing. This could be a short story, poem, blog post or tract about your own  or your characters' technical difficulties. How does this impact events? How does it make you or your characters feel? Has it ever been that much that you've put aside your device and preferred to find peace in the garden or a pint at the pub?
