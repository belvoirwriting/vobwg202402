Nostalgia, the old joke goes, isn't what it used to be. And now a sort of instant nostalgia seems to be served up every day by photo apps offering  notifications of "memories", flashbacks to the long ago times of last summer or packaged-up slideshows of the dog. Our writing theme for April dons some rose-tinted specs to declare "those were the days". How you use this is up to you, but a few possible questions to kick things off are:

-When were the days? 
-Where were you and who else was there?
-Were they really the good old days?
-Is it a wistful or perhaps even a sardonic statement?
-If you could go back, would you?

Whatever your medium, whether it's poetry, a short story, travelogue, lifestyle article pr something else completely, it would be wonderful to hear what you've been working on.

We'll be in the Old School, Bottesford from 8pm on 9 April 2024.
