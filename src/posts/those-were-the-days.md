Nostalgia, the old joke goes, isn't what it used to be. I remember when it was all talking-head clip shows of "celebrities" telling you why they loved the seventies or the eighties. You might get a supplement in the _Evening Post_, if you were lucky, all about Nottingham at war and the fun everyone had while they sheltered from the bombs. You'd have to walk all the way to the newsagents just to get that and a Maverick bar (or some other chocolate that they no longer make) though. It's not even called the _Evening Post_ any more. It's all on the internet.

You young people don't know what it's like to have to work to be sold your past back to you. You look at your phones with a daily dose of instant nostalgia by photo apps offering notifications of "memories", flashbacks to the long ago times of last summer or packaged-up slideshows of the dog, and think you're doing some remembering. 

Modern life is rubbish and you lot won't even get the musical reference to when music was good. 

Our writing theme for April dons some rose-tinted specs to declare "those were the days". How you use this is up to you, but a few possible questions to kick things off are:

- When were the days? 
- Where were you and who else was there?
- Were they really the good old days?
- Is it a wistful or perhaps even a sardonic statement?
- If you could go back, would you?

Whatever your medium, whether it's poetry, a short story, travelogue, lifestyle article or something else completely, it would be wonderful to hear what you've been working on.

We'll be in the Old School, Bottesford from 8pm on 9 April 2024.
