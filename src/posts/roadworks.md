It's our March meeting tonight but there's a snag if you travel in from outside Bottesford.

The A52 bypassing Bottesford is currently closed each night for works from 8pm till the next morning. 

You may be able to get to Bottesford in time for the meeting but may need an alternative route out if you depend on that bit of the A52. 

You can find a map of the road closure at https://one.network.
