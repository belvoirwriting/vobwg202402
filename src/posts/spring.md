It’s our March meeting this Tuesday at 8pm in the Fuller Room in Bottesford. (For anyone attending for the first time, this is next door to the library.) 

The optional theme is Spring, which could be about renewal, rebirth, or rejuvenation, or whatever you choose. How do you keep things fresh with your writing? Was there a moment of renewal when you found inspiration again? 

I’m taking the Spring theme to try writing something new to share on Tuesday. 

We had a good discussion last month using these questions from _Writing Magazine_:


>i) Take the story you are writing at the moment. Ask yourself: 

>1. What is the story about? 

>2. What is it really about? 

>ii)Strip two or three of your stories down to the essential conflicts of your main characters. Then answer the following: 

>1. What are their goals? 

>2. What are their hopes and fears? 

>3. What drives them? 

>4. What is the consequence of failure? 

>5. Reflect on these answers in light of your own lived experience. 



And we can revisit these for anyone that missed out last time. 



See you all on Tuesday,
