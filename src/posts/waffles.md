Sometimes the best advice is “just write”. And that’s what we’ve been doing. We’ve had a few themes that were not published here, _moths_ being one of them, but our main aims have been to keep writing and to keep meeting.

Our next meeting is on 12 October 2021 with an invitation to bring along works in progress. The theme title is inspired by our September meeting discussion of Norwegian waffles and Australian spaghetti bolognese but is even more optional than ever.

Use the form on the contact page to join us for more recipe ideas and writing chat.
