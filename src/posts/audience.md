I hope everyone that made it to the last meeting managed to get through the blockade on the A52 with a less eventful journey than the high-speed escape across Nazi-occupied Europe that we heard about. Though, if you were fleeing jackbooted fiends, I do hope you did it in style.

We covered a lot including modern poetry and how hard you have to work to sound so effortless. Hollie McNish had another mention, which is an excuse to link again to this video of her poem [_Megatron_](https://youtu.be/qCO-YmLT8t4) (warning: swearing). We returned to soil types and that the answer to all your soil woes is, as always, plenty of organic matter. We also discovered plants with personality that may only grow how you want them to after years of pleading, but possibly only to baffle you. And we heard about a Eurovision epiphany, a rail replacement service of the damned, and moustache horror.  

And we made room on the imaginary bibliography’s bookshelf for these cited works:
- [_The Eights_](https://www.joannamillerauthor.com) by Joanna Miller
- [_The Mysterious Benedict Society_](https://www.mysteriousbenedictsociety.com) by Trenton Lee Stewart
- [_The Winthrop Woman_](https://search.worldcat.org/title/70902093) by Anya Seton
- [_Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_](https://www.roalddahl.com/stories/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory) by Roald Dahl
- [_Ready Player One_](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/411399/ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline/9781784754792) by Ernest Cline
- [_Children of Time_](https://www.adriantchaikovsky.com/children-of-time-series.html) by Adrian Tchaikovsky

I hope you can join us for our next meeting on 8 July at 8pm in the Old School next to Bottesford library. Our completely optional theme is “audience”. This was inspired by a conversation we started at the last meeting and could be used as a writing prompt or just something to consider about how you write and for whom. Do you write for yourself or a specific reader or group of readers? Do you have an audience in mind? How does that shape what you write? And what kind of audience are you? Are you ever reading “as a writer”?

_Join us: Get in touch and we’ll add your email address to the distribution list. There are usually two emails a month with updates about the writing group and a reminder of the next meeting._
