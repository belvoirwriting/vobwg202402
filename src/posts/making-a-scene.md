Scenes! Yes, as dramatically announced at our last meeting, our next theme is “making a scene”. It will be our discussion starter and your optional prompt for a new piece of writing. 

What makes a good scene? What are the essential elements? How do you approach each scene? And do you agree with the “tips from the pros” from _The Writer_ May 2023?

You can read that issue and more through the Libby app (https://libbyapp.com/) if you’re a member of the library. 

Bring along an extract from your work in progress, or “making a scene” inspired writing, (approx 1000 to 1500 words max), and your thoughts on scenes to our next meeting at 8pm on 13 June at the Fuller Room, Bottesford.
